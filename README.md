# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
I worked for Creative Technology Solutions (CTS). My client, The Gaming Room, wanted us to develop a web-based app that can be used on multiple platforms. The current, and only, platform available is an android app. Draw It or Lose It is a game that competes to guess what is being drawn, or in this case what the image from stock slowly reveals.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I felt most comfortable with executive summary, design constraints, and the domain model. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Truthfully, the only section I referenced frequently when developing the code was the domain model. It gave me a rundown on what is needed and where those functions should be placed.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise a section, I would choose recommendations. Reason being, I would want to be more straight forward on what I believe is needed rather than including information that was not.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Some of the users needs include ability to use many operating systems, enough storage to store the images, security, the ability for multiple players to play together ignoring the differences in platforms, and most importantly create the game. 


# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
